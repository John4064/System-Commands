# System Commands

This is a program that will take a command list(txt) and execute all the commands in C and print the output only to the desired output directory. Version 2(prog03_v2) does the same exact thing but uses fork to optimize it a bit. Version 3(prog03_v3) Does the exact same thing but uses fork and exec to optimize the application!

## Installation

Clone the repo and from the src scripts directory run the start scipt
```bash
bash start.sh
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
